# The invariants, numbered

The artifact an auditor asks for: every guarantee this package makes, stated
once, numbered so it can be cited, and mapped to the executable check that
proves it. A guarantee with no test behind it is a preference.

`tests/invariants.test.ts` asserts that this table and the code agree — every
invariant below names a test that exists, and the count here matches the count
there. The document cannot drift from the suite without failing the build.
`vendor-invariants.mjs` at the root — a byte-identical copy of spec-kit's
`invariants/1` harness, pinned to canon by `tests/vendor-invariants-drift.test.ts`
and reported UNKNOWN when canon is absent — checks the same contract from the
command line (`node vendor-invariants.mjs check .`) and is what
`tests/invariants-harness.test.ts` drives: the invariants that are about *pairs*
of writes, run under every schedule the harness knows and under seeded random
command sequences, with the pre-fix reference store handed to the harness so a
green run means the harness can see.

## I-1 · Append-only

**Claim.** An entry, once written, is never modified or removed. A correction is
a new entry that references what it corrects.

**Why.** History you can edit is not evidence. The incident register, the
inclusion proofs and the anchored roots all rest on this one.

**Enforced by.** `LedgerStore` exposes no update and no delete — not as policy
but as absence, so there is no method to call. `reverse()` produces a
compensating entry rather than mutating the original.

**Proved by.** `ledger.test.ts` › *undoes by mirroring, never by editing history*,
and the two tamper checks that make the absence detectable rather than merely
intended: › *detects an entry edited after the fact* and
› *detects a removed entry by the break it leaves in the chain*.

## I-2 · Signed integer minor units

**Claim.** Every amount is a whole number of the asset's smallest unit, carried
as a branded `Minor`. Never a float, never a formatted string.

**Why.** Binary floating point cannot represent most decimal fractions exactly,
so sums drift as volume grows. The predecessor stored amounts as `Float` and 185
production rows disagreed with their own balance movement. See ADR 0002.

**Enforced by.** The `Minor` brand, so a raw number cannot be passed by accident;
`fromDecimal` throws `PrecisionError` on more precision than the asset allows,
rather than rounding.

**Proved by.** `ledger.test.ts` › *rejects precision the asset cannot hold rather than rounding it*,
› *rejects non-finite and non-integer values*, and
› *adds exactly where floating point would not* — the last being the case the
predecessor failed in production. The brand is a compile-time promise, so
`post()` re-asserts it at runtime on the one path every entry takes:
› *re-asserts the Minor brand at runtime, so a JSON body cannot hash a NaN, a fraction or a string into a chain*.

## I-3 · One sign convention

**Claim.** Credits are positive, debits negative, everywhere, with no unsigned
variant and no separate debit function.

**Why.** So that `SUM(amount)` means something. The predecessor had services
writing debits both ways, which made the sum meaningless and is precisely why
the reconciliation invariant on flashynetwork.com cannot yet run.

**Enforced by.** `post()` derives `balanceAfter` from the signed amount. There is
no API that takes a magnitude and a direction.

**Proved by.** `ledger.test.ts` › *debits with a negative amount, one convention throughout*,
and › *produces a matched debit and credit, never a bare balance edit*.

## I-4 · Idempotent writes

**Claim.** A write carries a key derived from its source event. A replay of that
key returns the original entry and writes nothing.

**Why.** Retries are constant at scale, and a retry that awards twice is a money
bug that looks like generosity.

**Enforced by.** A unique index on `(tenantId, idempotencyKey)`, so the database
refuses a duplicate even when two processes race — code in one file runs once per
process, an index runs on every write from every process forever.

**Proved by.** `conformance.test.ts` › *returns the original entry when a key is replayed, and writes nothing*,
run against every adapter, and
› *still deduplicates a genuine replay within one tenant*, which guards the
scoping change in I-6 from over-correcting into a lost deduplication. Under
interleaving, `invariants-harness.test.ts`
› *the same key appended twice, under every schedule: one entry on the record, both callers handed it, exactly one reported as new* —
sequential, both orders, started together, a macrotask apart — with the
mutation check › *refuses a store that forgot its key index: the replay lands twice on every schedule*.

## I-5 · Balances are derived

**Claim.** A balance is a fold over entries. Any stored balance is a cache of
that fold and must be rebuildable from it at any time.

**Why.** A cache can be rebuilt; a truth cannot. This is what lets projections be
sharded, rebuilt or thrown away, and what makes Σ(entries) = Σ(balances) a
meaningful question rather than a tautology.

**Enforced by.** `balanceOf()` folds entries; stores hold projections and are
never the source.

**Proved by.** `ledger.test.ts` › *derives a balance from entries alone*, and
› *keeps assets separate on one identity*, so the fold is per asset rather than
per identity. Under random sequences of `post`, `postTransfer`, `reverse`, a
replay and a write against a stale head, `invariants-harness.test.ts`
› *every stored balance is the fold over its entries, every chain verifies, every head is the last entry, and no balance goes negative except by a reversal* —
the stored state is compared to the fold after every command, so a store
whose projection can part from its entries fails the run.

## I-6 · Tenant isolation

**Claim.** Every read and every uniqueness constraint is scoped to one tenant. No
read returns another tenant's entry, and no write is refused because a different
tenant used the same idempotency key.

**Why.** Added in 0.2.0. `tenantId` was written onto every entry and used in no
query, which is harmless with one tenant and three money bugs with two — the
worst being a cross-tenant idempotency collision that returned another tenant's
entry while reporting a successful deduplication.

**Enforced by.** `AccountRef` and `HistoryRef` make the tenant a required
parameter, so a cross-tenant read does not compile; unique indexes on
`(tenantId, idempotencyKey)` and `(tenantId, identityId, assetId, previousHash)`;
`ensureIndexes()` drops the pre-0.2 global indexes, which would otherwise defeat
the change silently.

**Proved by.** `conformance.test.ts` › *tenant isolation* — six cases, run against
every adapter, of which four were verified to fail against the pre-0.2
implementation. The two that name the money bugs directly:
› *lets two tenants use the same idempotency key without deduplicating* and
› *scopes findByIdempotencyKey, so a lookup never returns another tenants entry*.

## I-7 · All or nothing consumption

**Claim.** A multi-asset consumption that cannot be afforded in full produces no
entries at all. No asset in the bill is debited unless every asset can be.

**Why.** Added in 0.3.0 with `postConsume`, the primitive building needs. The
failure it prevents is the partial spend: wood debited, stone found short, and
someone left poorer with nothing to show for it. That bug is silent — it surfaces
weeks later as a support ticket about missing resources, with no entry anywhere
saying what happened.

**Enforced by.** Ordering, not error handling. `postConsume` computes the
shortfalls across every cost before it produces a single entry, and throws
`InsufficientForConsumptionError` carrying all of them. The same `shortfalls()`
function answers the caller's "can this be built?", so a preview cannot disagree
with the rule. `allowNegative` is not part of `ConsumeCommand`, so a build cannot
be financed with debt by passing a flag.

Completeness of an *affordable* build is the store's guarantee, not the domain's:
the entries go to `appendAll` on a `TransactionalLedgerStore`. A loop over
`append` that fails on the third leg has spent the first two — the same failure,
one layer down.

**Proved by.** `consume.test.ts` › *destroys nothing — not even the assets it could have paid for*,
› *reports every shortfall, not the first one found*,
› *offers no way to finance a build with debt*, and
› *lands every leg together, and each asset keeps its own verifiable chain*.

## I-8 · Identities are opaque

**Claim.** An `identityId` is an opaque token scoped to one tenant. It is never a
natural key — never an email address, a phone number, a wallet address or a
public key.

**Why.** Added in 0.5.0. The ledger keys on a tenant-scoped identifier and never
resolves who a person is; linkage across tenants belongs to an identity layer,
where it can be consented to and withdrawn. A link recorded inside an entry
cannot be withdrawn at all — the entry is immutable and every subsequent hash
depends on it, so a consent revoked later has nothing to act on.

That reasoning is worth little by itself. The failure that actually happens is a
service passing `user@example.com` because it was the value to hand, into a
record that is append-only, hash-chained and published. A natural key correlates
across tenants **even with no shared namespace at all**, which makes the careful
scoping moot in practice and does so silently.

**Enforced by.** `assertOpaqueIdentity()`, called from `post()` before anything
is hashed — the one path every entry takes, rather than a helper a caller may
forget. The patterns are deliberately narrow: a guard with false positives gets
switched off, and then nothing is checked. ObjectIds, ULIDs, UUIDs, nanoids and
bare integers all pass, and base58 is not attempted at all because it cannot be
told from an opaque token.

`surrogateIdentity(value, tenantSalt)` gives the caller the fix rather than only
a refusal, and its per-tenant salt produces the pairwise property: the same
person at two issuers yields two unrelated identifiers, with no coordination
between the tenants.

**Proved by.** `identity.test.ts` › *refuses at post(), so no entry can be written that skips the check*,
which was verified by removing the call and watching it fail. The false-positive
half matters as much: › *does not reject a 24-hex ObjectId as a wallet address*
guards the one consumer this package has. The surrogate is held to
› *differs per tenant, which is the pairwise property*,
› *produces something the guard accepts* — otherwise the advice in the error
message would be wrong — and
› *refuses a salt short enough to be brute-forced*.

## I-9 · One head per chain

**Claim.** Every entry chains onto the head of its `(tenantId, identityId,
assetId)` chain as it stood when the entry was written. Two appends that both
read the same head cannot both land; the second is refused and the caller
re-reads state and retries.

**Why.** Added in the 1.0.x line. Port contract §4 had promised this since the
store interface was written, and the Mongo adapter kept it by a unique index on
`(tenantId, identityId, assetId, previousHash)`. The in-memory reference
implementation — the executable specification every adapter is measured against
— did not: two interleaved debits of a whole balance both settled, the stored
balance read zero, and the fold over the entries read minus the balance. A
transfer from an identity to itself was the same fault reached a different way:
both legs posted against one state, so the chain forked and the holder was
credited the sum of both legs.

**Enforced by.** `InMemoryLedgerStore.appendAll` computes the live head of each
candidate's chain — including anything staged earlier in the same batch — and
refuses a candidate whose `previousHash` is not that head, with the same error
the Mongo path raises when its index refuses the insert. `postTransfer` refuses
`from.identityId === to.identityId` outright, because no store can make two legs
on one head mean anything.

**Proved by.** `conformance.test.ts` › *refuses a second append on a head another append has already moved*
and › *refuses a batch whose entries fork one chain, and lands neither*, both
run against every adapter; and `ledger.test.ts`
› *refuses a transfer from an identity to itself, which would fork its chain and mint the amount*.

Those run the race in the order the test chose. Under interleaving,
`invariants-harness.test.ts`
› *two debits of the whole balance and a credit, every ordered pair, every schedule: exactly one of the debits lands, the chain verifies, and the stored state is the fold*
(nine ordered pairs, forty-five schedules), and the mutation check hands the
harness the reference store as it was before this invariant was enforced:
› *refuses the pre-fix reference store, whose appendAll ignores the head, on exactly the two started-together schedules* —
`a||b` and `b||a`, and no other: sequentially the second read sees the moved
head and `post()` refuses, and a macrotask apart the first append has landed.
That is the exact shape of the defect, a guarantee that held for one write at a
time. The same store under random sequences is refused by
› *refuses the pre-fix reference store under the same sequences — a write against a stale head lands, and shrinks to capture, write, stale write*,
the port's §4 case — a caller that did not re-read state — reduced to three
commands.
