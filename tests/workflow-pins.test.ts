/**
 * Every third-party action this repository's workflows call is pinned to a
 * full commit SHA, never a floating tag or branch — a tag can be retargeted
 * upstream (by the action's own maintainer, or by an attacker who
 * compromises their account) and CI would silently start running whatever
 * that tag now points to. A commit SHA can't move.
 *
 * `FlashyLabs/flashy-infra/.github/workflows/secret-scan-reusable.yml@main`
 * is exempt: it is an internal, org-owned reusable workflow, not a
 * third-party action, so it does not carry the same retargeting risk this
 * test exists to catch.
 *
 * Line-based, not a real YAML parser, matching this repository's existing
 * convention: a `uses:` line is simple enough not to need one, and it would
 * only miss a `uses:` hidden inside a multi-line YAML string, which none of
 * these workflows have.
