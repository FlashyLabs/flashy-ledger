// A shiplog for a repository that has no package.json.
//
// This is the plug-and-play surface, and it is the one that decides whether
// `shipped/1` is a standard or a thing one estate does. Two of the
// repositories here are dependency-free static builders and the portfolio
// companies most likely to adopt this are the least likely to want an npm
// install to do it. So: copy this file in, run it with node, get a sealed,
// valid fragment derived from the history the repository already has.
//
//   node vendor-shiplog.mjs emit [--since 2026-01-01] [--rev origin/main] [--out F] [--rederive]
//   node vendor-shiplog.mjs verify <fragment.json>
//
// Configure once in .shiplog/config.json:
//   {
//     "source": "repo/my-repo",
//     "org": "org/my-org",
//     "assertedBy": "agent/my-ci",
//     "defaultAuthor": "person/me",
//     "authors": { "bot@example.com": "agent/my-bot" },
//     "prBase": "https://github.com/me/my-repo/pull/",
//     "branch": "main",
//     "serve": "public/.well-known/shiplog.json",
//     "serveDevlog": "public/.well-known/devlog.fragment.json"
//   }
//
// `branch` is the branch the *workflow* runs on. The log itself is always
// derived from HEAD unless `rev` says otherwise — see revOf.
//
// Every `emit` also writes `DEVLOG.md` and `devlog.fragment.json` — a
// human-readable changelog, derived from the same commits, filtered by its
// own (stricter) rule. See devlog.ts / the `devlog/1` section of SPEC.md.
// Unlike the ship log, a devlog has no `visibility` tier: it publishes by
// default, because it exists only to be read. `commitBase` (or a `prBase`
// shaped like a GitHub pull URL, from which one is derived for free) is
// where each entry's `ref` points; `serveDevlog` is where the same
// unfiltered fragment is also written, exactly like `serve` does for the
// ship log.
//
// `serve` is the path the repository actually publishes from — the difference
// between a fragment that is committed and a fragment that is *reachable*. The
// estate learned this the expensive way with its directory fragments: they
// lived at the repository root, where a Next app serves nothing, so the
// federated merge could not be assembled by anyone without a git checkout,
// which defeats the entire point of federating it.
//
// ── Two things it does not do ───────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// It does not publish. Every entry lands `private`; making the log public is a
// decision somebody takes by editing `visibility`, not a side effect of running
// a script for the first time over a decade of branch names.
//
// It reads `--first-parent`, so an entry is a *merge to the deploy branch*
// rather than every commit. A log of every keystroke is technically accurate
// and unreadable, and it turns a velocity chart into a measure of typing.
//
// `vendor.test.ts` asserts this file's canonicalisation, digest and kind
// mapping match the TypeScript package. A vendored copy that seals *almost*
// the same way produces entries that fail verification for everyone else,
// which is the worst possible failure for a record whose point is being
// checkable.

  // rather than every commit. The consequence nobody saw coming: a commit that
  // is first-parent while you are on a branch stops being first-parent the
  // moment that branch is merged. Emit again and it is simply gone. Running
  // this in flashyos on 2026-08-30 took the fragment from 84 entries to 102 by
  // adding 32 and *deleting 14* whose commits were still perfectly reachable.
  //
  // So an emit is a union, not a replacement. Entries already in the fragment
  // are kept byte-for-byte — they are sealed, and re-deriving one would
  // recompute a digest that is not ours to recompute — and only genuinely new
  // ids are added. The result is append-only for the same reason the
