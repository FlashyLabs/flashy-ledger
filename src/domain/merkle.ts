/**
 * The Merkle tree over a day of ledger entries.
 *
 * This file is a specification as much as an implementation. A reader has to be
 * able to rebuild the same root from the published snapshot, in a language we did
 * not choose, without reading our TypeScript — otherwise the root is a number we
 * assert rather than a number they check, and a proof-of-reserves scheme whose
 * proof only we can compute is a press release with extra steps.
 *
 * ── The encoding ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 *   canonical(entry) = id | asset | type | source | amountMinor | recordedAt
 *                      joined with U+007C, no padding, no whitespace
 *
 *   leaf(entry)      = SHA256( 0x00 || utf8(canonical(entry)) )
 *   node(left,right) = SHA256( 0x01 || left || right )
 *
 * Leaves are sorted by entry id, ascending, byte-wise. Sorting rather than
 * preserving insertion order is what makes the tree reproducible from a snapshot
 * that someone re-serialised or re-ordered.
 *
 * ── Two details that are not incidental ─────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * 1. Domain separation. Leaves are prefixed 0x00 and internal nodes 0x01, so a
 *    leaf digest can never be reinterpreted as an internal node. Without this an
 *    attacker can present an internal node as though it were a leaf and forge an
 *    inclusion proof for an entry that was never in the tree.
 *
 * 2. Odd nodes are promoted, not duplicated. The common shortcut — duplicating
 *    the last node to pad a level to an even width — makes two different leaf
 *    sets produce the same root, which is the flaw behind CVE-2012-2459. A
 *    promoted node carries to the next level unchanged.
 *
 * Amounts are signed integers in minor units, per ADR 0002 in @flashylabs/ledger.
 * They are never floats here: a tree built over floating-point amounts would not
 * reproduce on a machine with a different rounding mode, which would make the
 * whole exercise worse than not doing it.
 *
 * ── Provenance ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * This module is the canonical home of the spec. It was written on
 * flashy-network (src/lib/merkle.ts) and moved here verbatim in 0.8.0 so that
 * the producer (ClaimYour.Gold's nightly anchor) and the verifier
 * (flashynetwork.com) import one implementation instead of maintaining two
 * copies of "the same" hash — which is how a chain silently stops verifying
 * across services. The network keeps a re-export until its next release.
 *
 * One mechanical delta from the original: index reads are guarded for this
 * package's noUncheckedIndexedAccess. Semantics and bytes are identical — the
 * pinned-vector tests prove it.
