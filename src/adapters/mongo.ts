/**
 * MongoDB implementation of the store port.
 *
 * The domain decides what an entry should be; this decides where it lives and,
 * critically, what the database itself refuses to allow. Three guarantees the
 * port demands are enforced by indexes rather than by code here, because code
 * in this file runs once per process and an index runs on every write from
 * every process forever:
 *
 *   1. `(tenantId, idempotencyKey)` is unique. A replay cannot become a second
 *      entry even if two processes race the same key at the same instant — and
 *      the tenant is part of the key, so two networks deriving the same key
 *      from similar source events do not deduplicate against each other.
 *   2. `(tenantId, identityId, assetId, previousHash)` is unique. This is what
 *      stops two concurrent appends both building on the same chain head — the
 *      second one violates the index and is retried against the new head rather
 *      than silently forking history.
 *   3. Nothing updates or deletes. There is no code path in this class that
 *      issues either, matching the port's requirement that entries are
 *      immutable.
 *
 * ON AMOUNTS
 * ──────────
 * Minor units are integers and can exceed 2^53 over a long-lived ledger, so
 * they are stored as BSON `Long` via the driver's `Int64`-ish handling and
 * converted at this boundary only. The domain never sees a Mongo type and this
 * file never does arithmetic.
